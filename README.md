# TagPic-mobile
mobile app that allows friends to geotag pictures (restuarants, bars, hikes, exhibits, etc.) and form them into threaded conversation. Threads can then be discovered by users near geotagged locations.

I'm slowly migrating this app over from another (private) repo and using it as an opportunity to learn some full-stack skills. It might be a brain-damage inducing pile of #?& until I have the time to get the front end working again.
